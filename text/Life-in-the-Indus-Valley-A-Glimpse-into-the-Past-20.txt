The civilization was named after the Indus River, which was a major source of water for the people who lived there.</p>
<p>The Indus Valley Civilization was a highly urbanized society, with well-planned cities, sophisticated drainage systems, and advanced architecture. The people of the civilization were skilled in various crafts such as metallurgy, stone carving, and seal making. They also developed a system of writing, which remains undeciphered to this day.</p>
<p>One of the most notable features of the Indus Valley Civilization was its cities. Mohenjo-daro and Harappa were two of the largest and most important cities of the civilization.
