<p>Indian culture has had a profound impact on the world throughout history. From ancient trade routes to modern-day globalization, India has played a central role in shaping the cultural landscape of our world.</p>
<p>One of the most significant contributions of Indian culture to the world is in the realm of religion. Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism all originated in India and have spread throughout the world, influencing the spiritual beliefs and practices of millions of people.

<p>Another major contribution of Indian culture to the world is in the field of art and architecture. The ancient Indus Valley civilization, which flourished in what is now Pakistan and western India around 2500 BCE, produced some of the most advanced and sophisticated urban planning of its time. The ruins of the Indus Valley cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro reveal an intricate network of streets, public baths, and monumental architecture, which have served as inspiration for architects and urban planners for centuries.</p>
<p>Indian literature has also had a profound influence on the world. The ancient Indian epic poems, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, are among the world's most enduring and beloved literary works, with a timeless appeal that transcends borders and cultures. The teachings of the Bhagavad Gita, a 700-verse Hindu scripture, is a popular spiritual text around the world.</p>
<p>In the field of mathematics, the Indian mathematician Aryabhata is considered one of the greatest of all time. His work on trigonometry, calculus and algebra have been a major influence on mathematics.</p>
<p>Indian cuisine is another area in which Indian culture has left a lasting impression on the world. Dishes such as curry, biryani, and tandoori chicken have become popular around the globe, and the use of spices such as turmeric, cumin, and coriander has become commonplace in international cuisine.</p>
<p>India has also made significant contributions in the field of philosophy. The Indian philosophers, including the Buddha, and the Upanishads, have had a profound influence on Eastern philosophy, including Chinese and Japanese thought.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Indian culture has had a profound impact on the world throughout history. From religion and art to literature, mathematics, cuisine and philosophy, the cultural contributions of India have shaped our world in countless ways and continue to do so.</p>
