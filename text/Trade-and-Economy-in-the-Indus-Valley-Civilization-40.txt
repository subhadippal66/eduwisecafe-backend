<p>The Indus Valley Civilization, which existed from around 3300 BCE to 1300 BCE, was one of the earliest urban societies in the world. The civilization, which covered an area that now includes parts of present-day Pakistan and northwest India, was known for its advanced city planning, sophisticated drainage systems, and impressive architectural structures. But the Indus Valley Civilization was also notable for its economic and trade practices.</p>
<p>The Indus Valley Civilization was primarily an agrarian society, with the majority of the population engaged in farming and animal husbandry. The civilization's economy was based on the production of crops such as wheat, barley, and peas, as well as the domestication of animals like sheep and goats. These resources were then used for both subsistence and trade.</p>
<p>Trade was an integral part of the Indus Valley Civilization's economy, and the civilization had a wide network of trade routes that connected it to other parts of the ancient world. The Indus Valley Civilization traded with Mesopotamia, which was located in present-day Iraq and Iran, as well as with the ancient civilization of Elam, which was located in present-day Iran.</p>
<p>The Indus Valley Civilization also had trade links with other parts of the Indian subcontinent, including present-day Afghanistan and Iran. The civilization traded a variety of goods, including precious metals, semi-precious stones, and textiles. Indus Valley Civilization also traded in luxury items such as ivory, shells, and pearls. These luxury items were used to make jewelry and other decorative items.</p>
<p>The Indus Valley Civilization's economy was also supported by the production of various craft goods, such as pottery and metal objects. These craft goods were both used by the civilization's inhabitants and traded with other cultures.</p>
<p>The Indus Valley Civilization had a system of weights and measures, which suggests that there was a degree of standardization and organization in their economic activities. The civilization also used seals and inscriptions, which have been found at Indus Valley sites, as a form of record keeping and possibly for commercial transactions.</p>
<p>The Indus Valley Civilization's economy was complex and diverse, and it is clear that trade played a significant role in the civilization's development. The civilization's trade links with other cultures helped to spread ideas and technologies, and the civilization's advanced economy allowed it to support a large population.</p>
<p>The Indus Valley Civilization's economy and trade practices were advanced for its time and laid the foundation for the economic development of the Indian subcontinent for centuries to come. Although this civilization disappeared around 1300 BCE, its economic and trade legacy lived on through the subsequent cultures of the Indian subcontinent.</p>
